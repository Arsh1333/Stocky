# ðŸ“Š Stocky Backend 

This project implements a backend system for **Stocky**, where users can earn shares of Indian stocks as rewards.  
The system tracks user rewards, company ledger entries, and provides APIs to query holdings and portfolio valuation.

---

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- Node.js + Express (Backend APIs)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- pg (Node.js Postgres client)
- dotenv (for environment variables)

## Edge Case Handling
- Duplicate rewards / replay attacks : use unique transaction IDs or UNIQUE constraints in DB.
- Stock splits / mergers / delisting : maintain an adjustment table and apply corrections to existing rewards.
- Rounding errors : all amounts use NUMERIC type instead of floating-point.
- Price API downtime : fallback to last cached price or retry mechanism.

## Scaling Explanation
- Indexes : add indexes on (user_id, stock_symbol) to speed up queries.
- Background jobs : use a scheduler (e.g., cron job) to refresh stock prices hourly.
- Caching : store frequently used portfolio values in Redis for quick retrieval.
- Microservices : split reward service, ledger service, and price service into independent services for high traffic.
- Horizontal scaling : deploy multiple instances of the backend behind a load balancer.
